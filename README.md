# SIUE BODe - ROBOTIC TOUR GUIDE
## Objective: The objective of this project is to give BODe functionality by training him to be a robotic tour guide for SIUE's Robotics Lab. 

Background: The project started with familiarization and investigation of BODe's operations and software. Once BODe was fully updated, recalibrated, and a new charger was allocated, the work on adding functionality began. A compressed starter kit is attached to this repository. It contains mixed-functional Python files, images used to train, and other useful content for adding more functionality to BODe. These files are suggested functionalities to add and ideas for how BODe can be advanced, rather than set goals to be finished. Feel free to download the kit for guidance and assistance when working with BODe. Good Luck!

Process: Below is a list of the milestones for this project.

1. SPOT Core I/O Integration
2. Fetch Mode 
3. Facial Recognition
4. Voice Recognition
5. LLM and Voice Capability
6. Tour Guide Mode 
7. Robotic Arm Integration
