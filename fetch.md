# Playing fetch with Bode
Bode can be commanded to find and pickup a toy ball and then bring it to a human. Using image recognition, BOde identifies the ball and walks to its location. With an external arm connected to the CORE I/O's GPIO ports, Bode picks up the ball from the previously identified location. Once again using image recognition, Bode finds a humand, walks to them, and drops the ball next to them.
## Ball
A ball with multiple high contrast colors was selected because it will be easier for Bode to recognize. Bode is not able to fetch for anything else.
